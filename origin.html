		<i>How he got his powers, and why does he fight for us?</i><br>

			<b>It was a dark and stormy night.</b><br>
			But the dining room of the Blackfield house was warm, cozy, and dry. Mr. and Mrs. Blackfield were having dinner with their 23-year-old son, Jerry. They didn't really see it as a problem that Jerry was still living with them, sitting in the basement playing video games all day, but they were starting to get a bit annoyed now. The one good thing, they thought, was that Jerry really likes calcium. At least, they thought it was calcium, considering he ate a bunch of foods that were high in it, like milk. <br>
			<br>
			Jerry wakes up at around one in the afternoon, has one meal at around 6, and another before he goes to bed at two in the morning, messing around on his computer for pretty much all the time in between. His parents used to call this "unhealty", but they've stopped doing that because Jerry never listened to that advice. Jerry was slightly regretful about his life at the time, but knew he couldn't really do much seeing as how he didn't go to college. At best, he thought, he could get a job at a McDonald's or something. <br>
			<br>
			One morning, er, afternoon, Jerry woke up. As usual, he played some games for a few hours. At around five forty five in the evening, his mother came down to the basement to tell him that dinner was ready. However, she couldn't find him! She thought to herself that maybe Jerry had finally gotten out of the house, and didn't think that much about it for the evening, enjoying her dinner. Jerry was, in fact, right in front of her when she came down to the basement, but for some reason, he blended in perfectly with the cement floor, and his mom didn't even know he was there. About two hours later, he came up, asking where dinner was. His mom, suprised, said she thought he was out of the house, and that he would have to get his own dinner. Slightly annoyed, Jerry quickly heated up some chicken nuggets from the freezer and retreated back to the basement. <br>
			<br>
			The next day, he remmbered what his mom had thought he had been doing and chose to leave the house for once. He was walking to the park to read a book, and some person in a skee mask ran up to him and threatened to stab him if he didn't give them all of his money. He hesitated, and the guy pushed him down on the ground. Jerry looked around for someone to help him or call the police, but no one was nearby. The person saw this and drew his arm back as if to stab him. Jerry threw his hand up, as if to stop him, and suddenly grey sludge splashed seemingly out of his hand and on to the person. It instantly froze him, and Jerry recognized the material as cement! <br>
			<br>
			Now, Jerry did take and pass his chemistry classes, and he knew what he liked about a lot of foods was the calcium, and he knew that limestone, and therefore, calcium, was a big part of concrete. He was stunned at this, and quickly connected it with what happened yesterday. He concentrated and threw cement again! Over the next few weeks, he started working out at a gym, trying out his new-found powers, and thinking about what to do with them. <br>
			<br>
			Eventually he decided to use them for good, and began defending the city and its citizens from criminals and evil people. His mom was happy for him, because he was getting out of the house. He came up with a costume and a name for himself. His name was: <b><i>LimeStone</i></b>.
