			<b>It was a dark and stormy night.</b><br>
			But the dining room of the Blackfield house was warm, cozy, and dry. Mr. and Mrs. Blackfield were having dinner with their 23-year-old son, Jerry. They didn't really see it as a problem that Jerry was still living with them, sitting in the basement playing video games all day, but they were starting to get a bit annoyed now. The one good thing, they thought, was that Jerry really likes calcium. At least, they thought it was calcium, considering he ate a bunch of foods that were high in it, like milk. <br>
			<br>
			Jerry wakes up at around one in the afternoon, has one meal at around 6, and another before he goes to bed at two in the morning, messing around on his computer for pretty much all the time in between. His parents used to call this "unhealty", but they've stopped doing that because Jerry never listened to that advice. Jerry was slightly regretful about his life at the time, but knew he couldn't really do much seeing as how he didn't go to college. At best, he thought, he could get a job at a McDonald's or something. <br>
			<br>
			One morning, er, afternoon, Jerry woke up. As usual, he played some games for a few hours. At around five forty five in the evening, his mother came down to the basement to tell him that dinner was ready. However, she couldn't find him! She thought to herself that maybe Jerry had finally gotten out of the house, and didn't think that much about it for the evening, enjoying her dinner. Jerry was, in fact, right in front of her when she came down to the basement, but for some reason, he blended in perfectly with the cement floor, and his mom didn't even know he was there.
