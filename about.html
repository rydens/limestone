		<i>LimeStone's abilities were created with this. What exactly is it?</i>

			Calcium, from Latin "calx", known on the Periodic Table as "Ca", has an atomic number of 20. This means it has 20 protons.
			Calcium also has an atomic mass of 40.08, and if we subtract the amount of protons from that and round a bit, we can easily find
			that this element has 20 neutrons. As you can see from the table on the right, Calcium is in Group 2, Period 4. That means there are 2
			valance electrons and 4 electron rings. Using this information, we can figure out the amount of sub-atomic particles in Calcium.<br>
			<br>
			20 protons, 20 neutrons, and 20 electrons. This alkaline earth metal was discovered by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808, after he thought the
			building materials used by ancient and modern folk alike might contain its element. This building material was limestone.<br>
			<br>
			Some physical properties of this element are:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>It has a melting point of 1,548° Fahrenheit.</li>
				<li>It has a boling point of 2,703° Fahrenheit.</li>
				<li>It has a density of around 1.55 grams per cubed centimeter (1.55g/cm^3)</li>
			</ul><br>
			<br>
			Some chemical properties of this element are:
			<ul>
				<li>It dissolves with strong acids, with a pH of less than or equal to 1, such as hydrochloric acid.</li>
				<li>Some compounds made with include limestone, marble, and gypsum</li>
			</ul><br>
			<br>
			Some uses include, but aren't limited to:
			<ul>
				<li>Used in cement and building materials</li>
				<li>Major part of life- All bones and teeth are formed mostly from calcium</li>
				<li>Calcium easily forms compounds, such as those used for buildings.</li>
				<li>MILK! Get more calcium, but not toooo much... You'll see what happens...</li>
			</ul><br>
